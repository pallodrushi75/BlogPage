            Envision this: there is a technology currently undergoing testing
            that, when released to the public, will become a long-awaited
            revolution in energy. This new technology promises to be safer and
            more efficient than anything we have on the market now. It will
            affect that which we consider mundane — power tools, toys, laptops,
            smartphones — and that which we consider exceptional — medical
            devices, spacecraft, and the innovative new vehicle designs needed
            to wean us off of fossil fuels. We have known about this technology
            for centuries, yet until now we have only been able to take small
            steps towards its creation. Billions of dollars are pouring into
            research and billions more will be made once the technology has been
            perfected and released.
